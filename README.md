The NFT ecosystem is here to stay and rapidly grow into the metaverse world. Being able to have access to any assets for one day or one month even if it does not belong to 
you should be a reality in the NFT world.

What does the project do?

Provide a simple platformer for users to can sell, stake and in a final stage rent their NFTs, in a decentralized platform, using smart contracts solution. 


Landing Contract  Workflow

  1. Users will have to register themselves somehow on the contract, using their metamask.

  2 . Users can mint their NFT

  3. Users can sell their NFT

  4. Users can stake their NFT  on the platform

Nice to have:

  5 . User can receive "rewards" for their assets in stake

  6. "Lanlords" Users can register their NFT on the smart contract, defining rent price, a period for renting, etc.

  7. "Tenant" Users canchoose an NFT to rend and register on their contract, the first rent period will be paid in advance.

  8. After seal the smart contract, the "Tenant" will have ownership over the NFT, thorough out the smart contract.

  9. The contract will be terminated after the defined period or in case the "Tenant" has no funds on their wallet.
