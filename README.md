### Provide a simple platformer for users to can sell, stake and in a final stage rent their NFTs, in a decentralized platform, using smart contracts solution.

### Landing Contract  Workflow

  - Users will have to register themselves somehow on the contract, using their metamask.

  - Users can mint their NFT

  - Users can sell their NFT

  - Users can stake their NFT  on the platform

### Nice to have:

   - User can receive "rewards" for their assets in stake

   - "Lanlords" Users can register their NFT on the smart contract, defining rent price, a period for renting, etc.

   - "Tenant" Users canchoose an NFT to rend and register on their contract, the first rent period will be paid in advance.

   - After seal the smart contract, the "Tenant" will have ownership over the NFT, thorough out the smart contract.

   - The contract will be terminated after the defined period or in case the "Tenant" has no funds on their wallet.  

### To do:
  - Create a token utility to reward the staking.
